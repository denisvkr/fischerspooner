		<section class="about">
		<p>Fischerspooner is an electroclash duo and performance troupe formed in 1998 in New York City. The name is a combination of the founders' last names, Warren Fischer and Casey Spooner. Influenced by retro electropop tendencies (arguably similar to Kraftwerk, early Pet Shop Boys, and Gary Numan) Fischerspooner uses a modern approach to programming.</p>

		<p>Originally a duo formed by classically trained musician Warren Fischer and video-artist and experimental theater performer Casey Spooner for an impromptu rendition of their makeshift track "Indian Cab Driver" at the Astor Place Starbucks, the group grew to over 20 performers, most of whom are dancers and guest vocalists. "We started as a performance art piece about entertainment that ultimately became legitimate entertainment",[1] said Casey Spooner, when talking about the group's origins in an April 2009 interview.</p>
